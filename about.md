I'm a computer science graduate from Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. I formally started my data science journey in the midst of 2019. It's been a bumpy ride ever since. Join me to see how everything pans along!

This blog for journaling my ðŸŽ’upcoming data science experiences. This blog runs on jekyll, is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and uses the <a href="https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">klisÃ©</a> theme.
