## 📩 Check-in

New year, new me. I'm not planning any new resolutions this year. I already have far too many to-do lists from last year that'll carry on to this year—one of them is waking up at the same time every day. One of my goals is to get into a good master's program, and the deadline for it is this December (2021). I'm going to list some of the tasks I would like to finish before applying there:

1. Publish four research papers or projects
2. Ace the GRE (330+)
3. Revise and master Calculus
4. Revise and master Data Structures and Algorithms
5. Revise and master statistics
6. Finish at least three specializations on data science (on Coursera)
7. Participate in at least two marathons (Hopefully COVID would have ended by then)

### 🦸🏻 Productivity superhero

Today's exercise focuses on self sabotage and how it affects our daily productivity.

> "And the lesson regarding it is: get out of your own way, understand how you’re self-sabotaging yourself and do those primary tasks that help you become organized, disciplined"

It also focuses on having a holistic goal, which comprises of:
1. Our body needs energy. 
2. Our mind needs clarity. 
3. Our emotions need confidence and harmony. 
4. Our soul needs significance.

Every time we think of a task, we need to keep these things in mind.

At this point, I think I've found my primary goal–I want to get into a tier one college for masters in data science. And I won't stop until I've accomplished this goal.

## ✅ Things I learned today:

1. Finish reading Day 12 of productivity superhero
2. Started a Coursera course on the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"Introduction to Philosophy"</a>
