## 📩 Check-in

I slept exceptionally early today, at around 9:35 pm. But I woke up at about 5 am as I wasn't able to sleep any further.

Nevertheless, I started working as early as I could and went for a jog. However, given that I hadn't jogged for almost two weeks, I ran for around 4 km (well below my 10 km benchmark). But, there's no giving up now; once this habit is in place, I'll be jogging every morning!

I think I can start logging my timings again.
