## 📩 Check-in

I woke up really late today! 20 minutes before work starts! That's not good! 😱

I couldn't exercise, nor eat breakfast. 

### 🦸🏻 Productivity superhero

No exercise today, just a moral:

> Follow your instincts. Don’t give up on your plans. Go all the way! Be your greatest fan!

💡 Just a reminder to pick up the book if you haven't – <a href="https://rupapublications.co.in/books/productivity-superhero-become-the-most-organized-and-disciplined-person-you-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"Productivity Superhero"</a> by Dan Luca

### Reduce Things to Learn

One of the readers suggested that I only put down three tasks to be done per day as a means to achieve my goal.  I'll put the remainder of the tasks in a backlog on my Notion board. Here's a snapshot of the same:

Taking their advice, here are the tasks:

## ✅ Things I learned today and yesterday:

1. Completed day 7 of productivity superhero

## 📚 Three things to learn tomorrow:

1. Continue writing an App review
2. Try out some Math problems from your IIM CAT study material
3. Finish reading the Lean Analytics Cycle article
4. Practice writing up metrics for a lemonade stand as an exercise for yourself
5. Learn how to use `tmux`
6. Finish understanding underlined words in chapter 1 and finish chapter 2 in Pragmarketism
7. What does `rel` in an anchor tag do (HTML)
