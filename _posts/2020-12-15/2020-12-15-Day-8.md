## üì© Intro

### The shower thing worked (sort of). 

"Shower thing" might sound a bit wrong for those of you just tuning in. But I attempted to take a shower almost immediately after work as a means of remaining fresh and jump into my studying sessions.

### Why sort of?

Since I delayed the shower by an hour, I started studying much later than I intended to. The issue is, work doesn't finish at the same time every day. I'll have to estimate my plans based on that dynamic scenario. 

Anyway, the list is as follows:

## ‚úÖ Things I learned today and yesterday:

1. Read "Subtle art of not giving a f*ck."
   1. Really good progress here (page # 142/171)
   2. Made some good highlights, might need to revist some chapters later if I do decide to make a blog post
2. Practiced reading comprehension (from IIM CAT study material) for 30 minutes!

## üìö Three things to learn tomorrow

1. Continue reading "Subtle art of not giving a f*ck."
2. Continue writing an App review (Watch out for the blog post this weekend!)
3. Try out some Math problems from your IIM CAT study material
4. Strengthen your understanding on the Lean Analytics Cycle
5. Practice writing up metrics for a lemonade stand as an exercise for yourself
6. Learn how to use tmux
7. Read Pragmarketism.
