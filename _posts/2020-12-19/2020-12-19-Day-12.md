## 📩 Check-in

Tried baking a pizza 🍕 today. Cooking took a lot longer than expected. Basically, couldn't get ANYTHING done today. 

### 🦸🏻 Productivity superhero

Today's exercise focused primarily on finding beliefs that tend to succumb to indiscipline. The one that resonated with me the most was:

> Avoid, as much as you can, the trap of "just this time"...Each exception not only atrophies your discipline but also weakens your self-esteem because you know you were weak and gave in (even if it was just that one time!.)

Once you perform the activity you were ever so wanting to abstain, like eating a banana split sundae during your keto dieting session, you slowly wither your ability to resist. In summary, **that one time is never the last**.

For example, I tried to justify not working today by telling myself, "I deserve a break," but in doing so, I always squandered away an entire day. In retrospect, I could've done some light reading 📖 instead of watching Netflix 🍿.

## ✅ Things I learned today and yesterday:

1. Read day 3 of "Productivity Superhero"

## 📚 Three things to learn tomorrow:

1. Continue/Start writing an App review
2. Try out some Math problems from your IIM CAT study material
3. Finish reading the Lean Analytics Cycle article
4. Practice writing up metrics for a lemonade stand as an exercise for yourself
5. Learn how to use `tmux`
6. Read Pragmarketism with the objective of finishing it in one day?
