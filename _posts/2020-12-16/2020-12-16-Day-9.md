## 📩 Intro

I couldn't get much work done since I woke up late. On the bright side, I did manage to set a goal to run at least 20 minutes today whilst also achieving it! However, the running did tire me early on, which led me to delay my learning progress.

I took inspiration from the following quote in the book:

> "When the standard of success becomes merely acting—when any result is regarded as progress and important, when inspiration is seen as a reward rather than a prerequisite—we propel ourselves ahead." — (Mark Manson; The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck)

Essentially, get yourself moving and stop wasting time!

Certain aspects of the book have positively impacted me. However, only time will tell whether I carry forward the advice from the book further.

## ✅ Things I learned today and yesterday:

1. Read "Subtle art of not giving a f*ck."
