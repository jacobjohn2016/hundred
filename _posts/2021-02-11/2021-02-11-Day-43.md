## ðŸ“© Check-in

Again slept a lot earlier than I was supposed to. I couldn't get as much work done yesterday (10th Feb, 21).

I was supposed to run 10k today (11th Feb, 21) morning but woke up late. Maybe I should stop using my phone in bed, with the lights off at night. I read somewhere that it's supposed to be bad for your sleep; it's beginning to reflect in my sleep.

It feels a bit weird doing a mid-day update. But I'm trying to at least fill out updates on some days. 

## âœ… Things I learned today:

1. Finished week 3 of the Philosophy course (FINALLY)

## ðŸ“š Things to learn tomorrow:

1. Start working on this data science problem â€“ Predicting Shipping costs [0% complete, due 6th March]
2. Continue writing NLP paper [9% complete, finish this by Feb 28th]
3. Read Poor Economics for 30 minutes [134/356 pages = 38% complete, finish this by end of Feb]
