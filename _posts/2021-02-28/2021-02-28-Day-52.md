## 📩 Check-in

> Tired, but let's do this

I was feeling a bit exhausted 🥵 after my run 🏃‍♀️ today. I had a stomach upset earlier this week, and it's beginning to get a bit warm. I suspect that's why I felt fatigued during the run. 

The battery 🔋 inside my MacBook 💻 started to leak 💦; I had to take it out 🧑‍💻. It was causing a bunch of issues which led me to have to reset my Mac. I had to sit down and re-install all my software which took quite a bit of time today–which sums up today.

One of Homebrew's dependency or a part of it's infrastructure seems to have had an outage today (13:45 UTC 28th Feb '21) [(Source)](https://github.com/Homebrew/discussions/discussions/962). Making it harder for me to install some binaries 🤷‍♀️.

I didn't post yesterday because I was working on the text processing paper and its <a href="https://github.com/jacobjohn2016/crime-heat-mapping" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Github Repo</a>. 

Finally, I also have started keeping track of things due in a week on a Notion board called weekly tasks. I tried doing this earlier but it didn't really stick. But no harm in trying again!
