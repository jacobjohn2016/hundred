## 📩 Check-in

The eating too much thing seemed to have really got to me 😩; I had a bit of a stomach upset today morning 😖. I clearly don't have an ironclad stomach.

### 🦸🏻 Productivity superhero

I've decided to skip reading this book for now. I can continue with the estimates thing and see where it takes me. The estimates thing as mentioned <a href="../Day-26+27/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">yesterday</a> is essentially marking the percentage completion of a task, followed by how long it might take to complete the entire task.

**Why skip the book?**

The book and the write up take roughly 20 minutes each day. I want to limit the time it takes to publish a post to 15 minutes. Furthermore, I feel like the book requires dedicated time for each exercise–which is overwhelming given the number of tasks I assign myself each day.
