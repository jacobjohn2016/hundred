description: Taking a day off
---

I was going through social media and reading about the crises around the globe - coronavirus, BLM, etc. Something that genuinely got to me was how people manipulate statistics to refute claims against movements. 

I read a comment on Instagram about how there's virtually no bias against races in policing matters. The comment was very well written, well structured, and well researched, which made it even harder to refute. Given the lack of knowledge I have in statistical inference, I decided to waste an entire day digging up articles and comprehensive studies. 

Eventually I found a blog post by <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01846-z' target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature</a>. Nature is a highly reputed academic journal with trustworthy sources and thorough analyses. Nevertheless, after reading the article, I was convinced that racially inequality is, in fact, prevalent. 

This got me thinking again; why did the comment initially make sense? After digging a little more, I found the sources the commenter was referring to - <a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/national/police-shootings-2019/' target="_blank" rel="noopener">Police Shootings database (2019)</a>. Turns out, the numbers quoted, despite being accurately calculated, are nowhere representative of the population. <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01846-z' target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature's blog post</a> criticizes this very dataset on only accounting for 40% of all brutalities. Furthermore, not to mention that this dataset is biased towards people who died due to police shootings - it doesn't mention anything about the use of brutal force. Lastly, the comment suspiciously only seemed to mention percentages that favor the argument. 

That's when it hit me - STOP WASTING TIME ON SOCIAL MEDIA. 

The comment seemed like just another way to stir up an unnecessary argument and gain traction on Instagram. Commenting on the article or further encouraging the debate would've gotten me nowhere.

If anything, I feel like I learned from this experience. Statistics can be dangerous in the wrong hands. I also learned how not to trust anyone who references Fox News.
