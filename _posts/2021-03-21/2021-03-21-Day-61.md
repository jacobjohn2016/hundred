## üì© Check-in

Couldn't wake up early today, need to keep working on that.

There have been a few developments during this week. I had to stop the Philosophy course due to the lack of time.

As an alternative, I've picked up a few statistics courses by PennState and MIT available online for free:

1. MIT <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-650-statistics-for-applications-fall-2016/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">18.650</a>: Statistics for Applications.
2. PennState <a href="https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat500/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stat500</a>: Applied Statistics

There's an initiative that I've signed up for called <a href="https://www.mentorswithoutborders.net/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mentors Without Borders</a>. It's a non-profit organization that aims to teach underprivileged professionals how to code. However, before teaching professionals, I have to go through a course that I need to pass. The sooner I completed the coursework and show the leadership that I'm capable of teaching, the sooner I can make a difference.
