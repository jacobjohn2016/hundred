## 🏃‍♀️ 10k, Finally!

I finally ran my first 10k last Saturday, 30th Jan '21. This exercise was after almost a year of not being able to complete 10k. Though I was running on a biweekly basis (twice a week), I couldn't run as much and hit my targets. This felt like a much needed break

## 📥 Things to do this week:

1. Finish reading 3 papers for NLP
2. Finish reading until page 150 of Poor Economics
3. Finish week 3 of philosophy course
4. Finish hackerearth data science problem
5. Finish writing the image processing paper
6. Write a blog post on OnePlus' Zen Mode
