## 📩 Check-in

> New month, new start

I'm back after a massive hiatus! I was busy working on an enormous image processing paper on object detection and finally submitted it yesterday. It isn't much, but you can find a compilation of some of the algorithms I used on <a href="https://github.com/jacobjohn2016/Object-Detection-Comparison" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Github</a>.

## 🏃‍♀️ 10k, Finally!

I finally ran my first 10k last Saturday, 30th Jan '21. This exercise was after almost a year of not being able to complete 10k. Though I was running on a biweekly basis (twice a week), I couldn't run as much and hit my targets. This felt like a much needed victory 🏆.

## 📥 Things to do this week:

1. Finish reading 3 papers for NLP
2. Finish reading until page 150 of Poor Economics
3. Finish week 3 of philosophy course
4. Finish hackerearth data science problem - <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-deep-learning-challenge-holidays/problems/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deep Learning Holiday Challenge</a>
5. Finish writing the image processing paper
6. Write a blog post on OnePlus' Zen Mode 
7. Publish a paper on <a href="http://arxiv.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">arxiv.org</a> - this is an environmental science paper.
