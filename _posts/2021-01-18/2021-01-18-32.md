## ðŸ“© Check-in

I took an extremely long break from blogging, but I think it's time to start getting back on track. 

I was planning to add a "Things due this week" section to every weekly post. This way, rather than cramming everything into each day, I'll be able to spread things out over a week. 

Ideally, I would like to work on this every Sunday, rather than Monday morning. At the end of each week, I'll review how of many of these I've finished.

Today's Monday, and I have a bunch of things planned for this week:

## ðŸ“¥ Things to do this week:

1. Finish reading 3 papers for NLP
2. Finish reading until page 150 of Poor Economics
3. Finish week 3 of philosophy course
4. Finish hackerearth data science problem
5. Finish writing the new image processing paper

## âœ… Things I learned today:

None, since I restarted.

## ðŸ“š Things to learn tomorrow:
