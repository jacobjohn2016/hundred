## ðŸ“© Check-in

Not doing any tasks today because I'm lazy, but I'll do a small exercise, something we do at Mentors Without Borders (MWB), as a means to focus on our goals. This exercise is called the mental process goals. The process is straightforward:
Write down a Goal (something measurable) and think about a moment in the future when you'll achieve that goal
Write down the steps you would have to undergo to progress towards and achieve your goal.
Put the efforts into practice.

The mental process philosophy is given enough focus to generate ideas, confidence, and energy to achieve your goal.
Given below are my goals and steps:

**Goal**: To get admitted into one of the top six universities for Data Science in the United States. These are, in no particular order:

* Massachusetts Institute of technology
* Carnegie Mellon university
* Stanford university
* Johns Hopkins university
* Harvard university
* Yale University

**Steps**:

1. Publish 10-11 papers [6 completed; 3 submitted; 1 in progress; 1 to be picked up]
2. Complete four Coursera Specializations
   1. Applied Data Science with Python ([https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python))
   2. Deep Learning ([https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning))
   3. Statistics with R ([https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics))
   4. Advanced Machine Learning Specialization ([https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/aml))
3. Revise Calculus skills via [MIT 18.01 Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01-single-variable-calculus-fall-2006/)
4. Revise Statistics skills via
   1. Penn State's Stat5XX courses, e.g. [Stat500](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat500/)
   2. [MIT 18.650: Statistics for Applications](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-443-statistics-for-applications-spring-2015/index.htm)
5. Ace the GRE (330+)

My focus currently is to complete all the steps by September, right before the application deadline.
