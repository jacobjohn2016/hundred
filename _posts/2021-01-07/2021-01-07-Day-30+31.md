## ðŸ“© Check-in

I got up sort of early for the last two days but couldn't get myself to run in the morning. But the good news is that the blog post on FLIP is finally complete! You can find my article here on <a href="https://medium.com/the-rising-tilde/flip-not-your-regular-pomodoro-app-35625c3ba468" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Medium</a>.

The review process got me extremely tired, which is why I combined yesterday's and today's blog post.

Here's a twitter post on the same:

Anyway will continue to try and wake up early, but this time go for a run in the mornings.
