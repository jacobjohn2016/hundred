description: Plan well and use the fudge ratio
---

I've had a major drop in productivity recently. I'm not going to blame the lack of motivation for this drop. A friend of mine quoted an interesting phrase to me, "if you wait for motivation, you'll never get things done". Starting tomorrow I've decided to use a pomodoro timer whenever possible. I'll start my day by setting a timer for getting ready in the morning, for breakfast and for studying. 

I'll try and use Thomas Frank's brilliantly devised <a href='https://collegeinfogeek.com/never-run-late-again/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>fudge ratio</a> and overestimate the time required to complete a task. Henceforth, I've decided to attach the time associated to each task:

## 📚 Important tasks for today:
1. Finish cousera statistics week 4 videos (120 minutes)
2. perform time series prediction (180 minutes)
3. Do datacamp (80 minutes)
4. Jogging (90 minutes)
5. Deep Learning (70 minutes)

## ✅ Things I completed today:
1. Did statistics
2. Did datacamp
3. Started with time series prediction

Fell sick today so progress was again hampered. Fingers crossed that I feel well tomorrow!
