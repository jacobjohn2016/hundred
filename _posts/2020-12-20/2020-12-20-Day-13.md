## 📩 Check-in

I procrastinated way more than I should have today. 

### 🦸🏻 Productivity superhero

Today's chapter focuses on the "higher purpose that fuels discipline." This chapter felt like a beacon 🔥 of hope during lost times. This section asks us to define and work towards a better version of ourselves. Essentially picture yourself twenty years from now and envision your future. I wouldn't go that far into the future (1 year should be sufficient), but today's section enabled me to ponder upon my:

1. Health - I want to be consistent with my exercising routine
2. Productivity - I want to be able to filter out distractions
3. Focus - I want to be able to focus for 4 hours, uninterrupted (with occasional 5-minute breaks)

Back in college, I was powered by the fear that I might fail my exams or not perform well. I flunked my first-semester Calculus course, and ever since then, I've tried developing a rock-solid at least a month before exams. 

I need to find the develop a similar forethought (or anxiety) for myself today.
