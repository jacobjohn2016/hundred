## 📩 Check-in

Rule #1: Don't eat so much.

I ate far too much for dinner tonight. During my last task today, I had to stop working and walk. I felt extremely lethargic. So lesson definitely learned.

### 🦸🏻 Productivity superhero

Today's exercise focuses on listing out all the tasks that I need to complete. List the percentage they're complete and estimate how long they're going to take to complete. 

I'm going to start by doing the same here.
