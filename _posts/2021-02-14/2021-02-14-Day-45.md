## ðŸ“© Check-in

Time for a weekly review and planning for next week.

Things went relatively well at the start of the week. I finished week 3 of the Philosophy sooner than I planned. However, the learning pace slowed down since then. My aim this week is to try and be more consistent.

## ðŸ“¥ Things I did this week:
