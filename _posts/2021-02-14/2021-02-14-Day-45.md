## üì© Check-in

Time for a weekly review and planning for next week.

Things went relatively well at the start of the week. I finished week 3 of the Philosophy sooner than I planned. However, the learning pace slowed down since then. My aim this week is to try and be more consistent.

## üì• Things I did this week:

| Planned                                                             | Progress                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Finish reading 2 papers for NLP                                     | Read 2 papers                                     |
| Finish reading until page 150 of Poor Economics                     | Read until page 150                               |
| Finish week 3 of philosophy course                                  | Completed week 3                                  |
| Finish hackerearth data science problem - Predicting Shipping costs | Just started this today                           |
| Finish writing the image processing paper                           | Completed this and published another one on arxiv |

Let's try something new this week. I've purchased a premium version of a pomodoro app from the play store called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apps.adrcotfas.goodtime&hl=en_IN&gl=US" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GoodTime</a> [^1].

I'm planning to do at least 3 Pomodoros outside of work and 2 during Work. My work pomodoro sessions are 40 minutes long while my study pomodoro durations are 30 minutes long. This means:

$$ 30 \times 3 = 90 \text{ mins or } 1.5 \text{ hrs for studying üôá‚Äç}$$

$$ 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ mins or } 1.3 \text{ hrs for work üë®‚Äçüíª}$$

Ultimately, we need to study $$ \geq 90 \text{ mins}$$ and work for $$ \geq 80 \text{ mins}$$ per day. At the end of each week I'll post the statistics here as such:
