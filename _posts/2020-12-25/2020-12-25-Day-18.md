## 📩 Check-in

Merry Christmas 🎄 readers!

Today was fun as a significant chunk of my time was spent eating, sleeping, and relaxing.

I did manage to get some light reading done, albeit it was during the late evening. The sluggishness was expected given that today was Christmas.

### 🦸🏻 Productivity superhero

Today's lesson was on organization and discipline. The primary purpose of today's exercise is to understand the difference between effectiveness and efficiency. As described by the author:

> "Effectiveness means doing things well and fast. Efficiency means doing the right things."

The main takeaway of this exercise is to replan my To-Do list. Task priorities should be assigned based on the output they produce. Furthermore, it is also essential to evaluate the weightage of this output in my life.

## ✅ Things I learned today:

1. Read day 8 of productivity superhero.
