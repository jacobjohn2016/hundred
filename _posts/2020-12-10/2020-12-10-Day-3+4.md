Let's not make this a habit. I'm combing day \#3 and \#4 into one blog. Output was bare minimum yesterday; however, I did make an effort to read a bit today. Let's aim for something useful over the weekend.

I've also changed the format to reflect on what I did today first before I plan for tomorrow.

## ‚úÖ Things I learned today and yesterday:

1. Read some research literature the psychology behind habit
2. In the process of reading the lean analytics cycle
   1. You can find the same article<a href="https://www.kaushik.net/avinash/lean-analytics-cycle-metrics-hypothesis-experiment-act/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
   2. Might be a good idea to do an exercise
   3. Write up an article on what the metrics of a lemonade stand could be 
3. Reading "Subtle art of not giving a f*ck." 
   1. I'm on page (106/171)
   2. Making some progress here

## üìö Three things to learn tomorrow

1. Continue reading "Subtle art of not giving a f*ck."
2. Continue writing an App review (Watch out for the blog post this weekend!)
3. Try out some reading comprehension from your IIM CAT study material
4. Strengthen your understanding on the Lean Analytics Cycle
5. Practice writing up metrics for a lemonade stand as an exercise for yourself
6. Learn how to use tmux
7. Read Pragmarketism. You can find the book <a href="https://harpercollins.co.in/product/pragmarketism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
