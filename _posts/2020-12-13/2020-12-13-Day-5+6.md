## 📩 Intro

> Day 5:  13th December, 2020 <br>
> Day 6:  14th December, 2020

I'm having this realization that maybe I need to plan things a day at a time. Furthermore, I need to find the motivation to learn more.

## ✅ Things I learned today and yesterday:

1. Read "Subtle art of not giving a f*ck."

## 📚 Three things to learn tomorrow

1. Continue reading "Subtle art of not giving a f*ck."
2. Continue writing an App review (Watch out for the blog post this weekend!)
3. Try out some reading comprehension from your IIM CAT study material
4. Strengthen your understanding on the Lean Analytics Cycle
5. Practice writing up metrics for a lemonade stand as an exercise for yourself
6. Learn how to use tmux
7. Read Pragmarketism.
