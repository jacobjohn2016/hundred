## ðŸ“© Check-in

Being motivated enables you to explore things. If you're not motivated, you just tend to focus on getting the job done and not getting it done well. 

This is sort of happening with me these days. Also I'm beginning to feel sleep earlier these days, so need to figure a way out of that.

## âœ… Things I learned today:

1. Continued finding resources for writing the paper
2. Watched a video on the Philosophy course
3. Read a little bit of Poor Economics
