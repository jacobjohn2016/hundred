## üì© Check-in

Made some decent progress today. But didn't anticipate a couple of chores today which disrupted my schedule.

I woke up late and deviated from my tasks, but I ultimately started doing some work. However, towards late evening, I began getting distracted again. One of the primary reasons might be a decadent dinner. Usually, most meals, I tend to get lazy and start watching Netflix. I'll try going for a light walk post heavy meals as a means to assuage lethargy.

### ü¶∏üèª Productivity superhero

Today's exercise focuses on shifting our productivity paradigm and moving to new efficient ones. I won't list out all the new paradigms that productive people abide. Instead, I'll state the paradigms I want to put an effort in:

* Managing my energy correctly instead of managing my time: this means scheduling tasks in such a manner that I don't mentally drain myself early on. Furthermore, it also means avoiding tasks such as shopping that tend to induce decision fatigue early on during the day.
* Taking shorter and more wholesome breaks rather than long distracting ones, e.g., going for a walk, doing push-ups, etc. rather than surfing social media.

Lastly, continue to log down my day to understand where majority of the time gets wasted. 

### What is `rel` in HTML?

* An attribute of the anchor `a` tag
* The `rel` attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document.
* Only used if the `href` attribute is present.
* the `noopener` attribute value prevents your site from cross site hacking
  * prevents the linked document from altering javascript properties on the original site
  * E.g.:

```html
<a rel="noopener" href="http://www.functravel.com/">Cheap Flights</a>
```
