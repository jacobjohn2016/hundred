## 📩 Check-in

### So what happened yesterday?

I couldn't create a good post as I procrastinated on a task. I delayed its completion by two weeks and didn't pick it up correctly until late last night. In fact I had to wake up early morning today, just to finish it! 

I should probably start completing tasks well ahead of schedule because:

1. I would love to sleep on time.
2. Feel motivated to do more.
3. Not have the burden of doing it last minute.
4. Free up my schedule to do other important work.

## ✅ Things I learned today:

Nothing, too sleepy 💤 from yesterday to pick up anything today. Going to bed as soon as I brush my teeth.

## 📚 Three things to learn tomorrow:

1. Read day 11 of productivity superhero
2. FLIP App Review
3. Read Natural Language Processing (NLP) papers
4. Read Poor Economics
