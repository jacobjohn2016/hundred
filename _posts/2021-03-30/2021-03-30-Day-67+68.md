## ðŸ“© Check-in

> Day 67: 30th March, 2021 <br>
> Day 68: 31st March, 2021

I woke up a bit early both on Day 67 and 68, but I couldn't go for a run.

I was awake at 8:10 am on Day 67 and 7:30 am on Day 68, which is about an hour later than when I can go for a run. It gets scorching and sunny at around 8:10 am, and there's a lot of traffic on the streets, making it difficult to jog. 

Perhaps I can try my best to wake up earlier tomorrow?
