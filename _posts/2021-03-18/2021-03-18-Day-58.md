## 📩 Check-in

### ☀️ Morning Update

I can't seem to get up early morning, and I haven't gone for a jog in almost two weeks. My 10k time has gone for a toss, and it seems like I'll have to start all over.

It's the starting all over that I mind; it's the getting in the morning. I just can't seem to figure out a way.

### End of day

So after researching a bit, I found a couple of interesting links on getting up early. According to <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cant-wake-up#solutions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Healthline</a>, in order to train myself to wake up early, I need to:

1. Get on a sleep schedule: I want to maintain a schedule of – going to bed at, 11:30 pm and wake up at 6:45 am. The same also applies for the weekends. I'll try and avoid watching TV shows past 10 pm on the weekends as well. 🛌
2. Improve your bedtime routine:
   1. Avoid drinking caffine at least 5 hours before sleeping, i.e., no coffee or sodas after 6:30 pm. ☕️
   2. Avoid screen time at least 30 minutes before sleep, i.e., a blackout period at 11 pm (no screens after this time). 📲
   3. Don't nap during afternoons. 🌅
3. Move your alarm to avoid hitting snooze (avoid sleep fragmentation): I need to keep my alarm far enough such that it's difficult to reach it and yet close enough such that I can hear it. ⏰
4. Eat better: Avoid eating past 9 pm. 🍎
5. Enjoy the daylight: Sleep with my blinds open. ☀️

I'll be stopping the Philosophy course on Coursera. It's taking up too much time, and I feel there are other pressing tasks at hand.
