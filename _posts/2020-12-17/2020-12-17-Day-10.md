## üì© Check-in

### New Sleep Routine

Woke up a bit early today: <br>
üõå Slept at around 1:10 AM <br>
‚òÄÔ∏è Woke up around 7:20 AM <br>

Six hours of sleep doesn't seem reasonable. I felt groggy mid-day and couldn't jog nearly as much as I usually do. I should try and fall asleep earlier, maybe around ~~11:30 pm~~. Due to some work, I think I'll have to end up sleeping later than usual. 

### Productivity superhero

I've began reading the book "Productivity Superhero" by Dan Luca (<a href="https://rupapublications.co.in/books/productivity-superhero-become-the-most-organized-and-disciplined-person-you-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Link</a>). The book explores a series of day-wise tasks to be followed that help you become organized and disciplined. I'm currently on Day 1, and the way the book defines "Discipline" really resonates with me:

> "Self-discipline is the ability to get yourself to take action regardless of your emotional state...(it also) helps you evolve little by little every day."

The above is a combination of Steve Pavlina's[^1] and Dan Luca's definitions. Dan continues to explain the ramifications of his approach, and the ones that best represent my state are:

- inability to respect personal deadlines for "learning."
- working overtime due to a lack of organization 
- not being as effective at my work as I can be[^2]

Dan finishes each chapter with a list of To-Dos. I've decided to share the same list with you, my audience[^3]:
1. Find your definition of Discipline:
   1. "I feel I'm disciplined when I jog every day" 
   2. "I feel I'm disciplined when I finish the tasks I've planned out" 
   3. "I feel I'm disciplined when I wake up on time" 
2. Find your definition of organization.
   1. "I feel I'm organized when I've created a plan for myself"
   2. "I feel I'm organized when all my files are in the correct folders" 
   3. "I feel I'm organized when I meet my deadlines on time"
