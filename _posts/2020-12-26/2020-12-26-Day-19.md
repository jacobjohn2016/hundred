## 📩 Check-in

I couldn't get any work done today as I was busy eating 🍽 and being lazy 🛏. But, I will copy my tasks that were due today into tomorrow's calendar.

### 🦸🏻 Productivity superhero

Today's exercise focuses on establishing daily priorities. I won't be doing the exercise assigned for the day since I don't feel that it applies to me. Instead, I'll try and record my ability to stick to the schedule set. I'll make a log of the tasks I did on paper and see how far I deviate from it. 

## ✅ Things I learned today:

1. Read day 9 of productivity superhero.

## 📚 Three things to learn tomorrow:

After looking at my calendar, these are the tasks in chronoligical order:

1. Learn how to use `tmux`
2. Lean Analytics Cycle article
   1. Finish reading the article
   2. Practice writing up metrics for a lemonade stand as an exercise for yourself
3. What does `rel` in an anchor tag do (HTML)
4. Read Poor Economics
5. Try out some Math problems from your IIM CAT study material
6. FLIP App Review
7. Read Natural Language Processing (NLP) papers

The activities are timeboxed, so fingers crossed 🤞 that this works out, again.
