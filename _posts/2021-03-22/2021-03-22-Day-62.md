## ðŸ“© Check-in

I sort of injured my leg after overexercising yesterday. I couldn't focus on much today.

I absolutely cannot afford to stay distracted anymore. I'm tired, but I need to retain my focus throughout. I think it's time I cut myself out of Netflix and Prime video. I should try and resort to watching Statistics videos instead to build upon my understanding of the subject.

## âœ… Things I learned today

Ouch my leg.

## ðŸ“š Things to learn tomorrow

1. Read Poor Economics for 30 minutes [183/356 pages = 51% complete, finish this by end of March]
2. Read 1 paper for NLP [Due 23rd Mar]
3. Prepare for Mentor without Borders interview [Due 23rd Mar]
4. Study probability distributions for a total of an hour [Due 23rd Mar]. Should complete the following:
   1. Normal distributions
   2. Evaluating the normal approximation
   3. Start with Geometric Distributions
