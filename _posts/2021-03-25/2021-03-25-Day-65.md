## ðŸ“© Check-in

My main goal currently is to get into a good master's program. A critical component of the application is the GRE score. The GRE is a 3-hour 45-minute exam that requires immense patience and concentration. My concentration currently is very poor; I can barely sit and study for an hour straight.

To improve my attention, I need to practice. One way I thought about practicing is increasing my Pomodoro duration from 30 minutes to 110 minutes. Thus resulting in:

$$ 110 \text{ mins focus } + 12 \text{ mins break } + 110 \text{ mins focus } + 25 \text{ mins break } + 110 \text{ mins focus } + ... $$

However, with sessions this long, most of the 25-minute breaks might occur during lunch and dinner.

## âœ… Things I learned today

1. Studied probability distributions for a total of an hour. Completed the following:
   1. Normal distributions
   2. Evaluating the normal approximation
   3. Start with Geometric Distribution
2. Read Poor Economics for 10 minutes

## ðŸ“š Things to learn tomorrow

1. Read Poor Economics for 30 minutes [198/356 pages = 56%, finish this by end of March]
2. Study Hackerearth Problem
3. Read 1 paper for NLP [Due 25th Mar]
