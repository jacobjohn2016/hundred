## 📩 Check-in

I finally woke up at 7:30 am today and went straight for a jog 🏃‍♀️. I didn't run much, but this was excellent progress. I need to continue this for the next three days to know for sure that this will work.

Work ran a bit late today, so I couldn't get a lot of learning done and focused on mainly writing after work.

## ✅ Things I learned today:

1. Continued writing up the FLIP app review
   1. Made good progress here
   2. Expect the article to be published by Friday
   3. This is looking less like a review and more like an article about the app
2. Continued writing NLP paper

## 📚 Things to learn tomorrow:

1. Continue Philosophy course [20% complete, 4 weeks remaining]
2. Continue FLIP App Review [60% complete, 3 days remaining]
3. Start working on this data science problem – <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-deep-learning-challenge-holidays/problems/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deep Learning Holiday Challenge</a> [0% complete, 2 weeks remaining]
4. Continue writing NLP paper [8% complete, finish this by Feb 28th]
