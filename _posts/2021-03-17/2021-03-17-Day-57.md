## 📩 Check-in

I need to get back into the cycle of waking up early and going for a jog. I haven't gone for a 10k in a while now.
🤞 Fingers crossed that I get up tomorrow. (Pretty much the same thing I said last week).

I got some work done today. I think I'm slowly getting back into the cycle of getting my tasks done. Though I didn't time my study duration so profusely, I spent around 30 minutes today studying.
