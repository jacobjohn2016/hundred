description: Starting fresh and reflecting
---

If I'm being honest with myself, this daily progress thing isn't working well. Even though some blogs recommend reflecting on what you learn every day, I personally haven't seen myself benefiting from it lately. So I've decided to approach this by posting an updating weekly. 

My new planning strategy for the upcoming week is to:
1. Plan my week on Notion - jot down all the objectives or goals for this week
2. Convert these objectives into actionable goals on the apple calendar app
3. Reflect on what I've achieved and not achieved on Sunday on this blog

I've already drafted a template for next Sunday. Fingers crossed that things go well. ðŸ¤ž
